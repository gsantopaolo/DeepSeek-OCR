overlap and occlude each other (indicated by *i* for "interfering"). The annotated picture representation can then be used as one of the knowledge sources in the NLG system to select and structure information appropriately in generating the captions.

5. Generating Explanatory Captions

A high-level overview of the system divided into functional modules is shown in Figure 17. A brief description of each module is given below. Detailed descriptions follow later in the section.

non-occluding. Consider, for instance, the chart shown in Figure 8. The mark indicating the agency estimate of the selling price often overlaps with the interval bar showing the actual asking and selling prices. In some cases, the asking and selling prices are so close that the mark indicating the agency estimate actually occludes the interval bar. Clusters such as this can hinder interpretation and it is important that such mappings be clarified.

4.5 Alignment Complexity
As illustrated in Figures 6, 7, and 9, alignment of multiple charts and/or tables can be a useful technique for supporting comparisons, rapid lookups for many attributes of the same object, and for maintaining consistent scales. Whenever an alignment occurs, all but one of the charts become separated from the aligning axis labels and the relation between the aligned axis and the rest of the charts may not be clear.

The complexity assessment module in the system is capable of identifying the graphemes in the display that are complex for any of the five reasons described in this section. It annotates the picture representation generated by SAGE to indicate the graphemes and their types of complexity. The result of the complexity assessment for the Minard graphic—Figure 1—is shown in Figure 15. As discussed earlier, for instance, the mapping between the attribute temperature and the color of the line is complex for two reasons: (i) encoding complexity, because of the use of color and saturation, and (ii) range complexity, because of the unequal distributions of warm and cold temperatures. Figure 16 gives the complexity assignment for the graphic

Resilient full-year results reflecting ongoing strong operating performance

FY 2024

Growth momentum

– Strong franchise growth across all four divisions, full confidence in the ability to reach ~€32bn ambition for FY 2025¹
– Revenue momentum supported by growth in noninterest income and areas of targeted investments, offsetting NII normalization
– 75% revenues from more predictable streams including Corporate Bank, Private Bank, Asset Management and FIC Financing
– Sustained revenue growth momentum with Group CAGR² of 5.8% in line with updated target of 5.5% to 6.5%
– FY 2024 reported RoTE of 4.7%

Disciplined execution

– Delivered operating costs in line with guidance while investing in business growth; absorbed significant nonoperating cost items and improving future performance as well as risk profile
– Incremental franchise growth in 2025 to be achieved with flat operating costs
– Reset of cost/income ratio (CIR) target to below 65% reflects investments to drive continued progress beyond 2025

Resilience

– Capital position robust with CET1 ratio at 13.8% at year-end 2024, despite absorbing litigation charges and capital deduction for the €750 million share buyback announced
– Aim to operate with a buffer of 200bps above the bank’s expected MDA threshold, as Deutsche Bank builds capital and absorbs regulatory changes

Sustainability

– Continued increase in Sustainable Finance volumes by €93bn in 2024 to €373bn cumulative since 2020

¹ With potential upside from currency translation effects
² Compound annual growth rate since 2021
³ For a description of this and other non-GAAP financial measures, see ‘Use of non-GAAP financial measures’ on pp 15–22 of the fourth quarter 2024 Financial Data Supplement
